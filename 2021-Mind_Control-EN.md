# <a name="intro"></a> Introduction 

It may seem unbelievable to you, but you are a cyborg today. Not the metaphor of a half human, half robot individual, but a cyborg today in reality. Conscious or unconscious, willingly or not, we all live in a hybrid reality mixing biology and digital technology, where a global artificial intelligence lives within our heads, interacts with them and control your mind. Do you remember the Matrix and the movie of the same name? You are in it.

**How?** Thanks to artificial intelligence.

From voices to synthetic emotions, from haptic exoskeleton to 3D computer-generated dreams, images transmitted in real time, induced narcolepsy, memory tuning to psychiatric brainwashing, the Matrix has many sophisticated and sometimes crual features to correct and enhance the human body. At the top of these features, AI haptic control, allows it to take physical control of targeted individuals from a distance.

**Why?** Because mankind is in danger according to the Matrix and its creators. 

Notably by modernity, of which the Matrix or AI control system is paradoxically the most convincing example. Today, man creates digital solutions to physical problems, and unfortunately these digital solutions themselves lead to new physical problems, which by the play of scale, are instantly globalized. How can we respond to global problems that affect all our heads? With a global solution that also affects all heads.

Through a number of technical processes integrated together in the form of a machine (later in the guide we will talk about system, platform, AI or Matrix) allowing for the seamless interaction between the Cloud and human brains.

This guide is an effort to educate and denounce this societal reality, where some people have been aware of the existence of a cognitive control infrastructure for a long time and others have not. If today this system is confidential, in spite of its size and technical ambition, it is mainly because of the fear it arouses and the difficulty of fully understanding it.

Youngest ones talk about being ***matrix'd***.

In this guide, we are going to popularize as much as possible the socio-economic and technical elements allowing to understand the ins and outs of a cognitive control system, in order to offer to everyone a non-biased way of understanding, far from ideological or political trends.

In this respect, the author invites the reader to keep a cool head, especially with regard to his relatives or friends who have kept the secret: the installation of an individual in the system generates deep social and psychological difficulties for him or  her, removing most of his or  her possibilities of choice. From the author's point of view, informed or not, everyone is now a victim.

The message of this guide is therefore simple, to overcome the present situation by opening it up. First of all, current problems, which for some people legitimize the implementation of cognitive control systems, then technological solutions which are not well known and which allow the experimentation of cognitive control by AI in real conditions, and finally the risks linked to the use of these systems, and to their design.

Although it is present in the subtitle, the word transhumanism will never be used thereafter. It is an exotic and complex term that is intended to obscure the reality, i.e. cognitive control by remote AI, rather than to make it explicit.

# <a name="part-0"></a>Part 0: You have just entered the control system. 

All of a sudden you hear voices? You feel as if you are intermittently electrocuted? Your movements and sight seem to be controlled? Your dreams have become interactive and bizarrely realistic?
Watch a movie or read a book and drink some water.

## <a name="part-0.1"></a>Rule number 1: Don't panic.

No matter what level of violence you encounter or experience, it's all virtual and has only one purpose: to help you maintain your health.
Rule number one: relax, there's nothing you can do about it. 

Relaxing is the most important thing to do in order to progress quickly in the first phase of your installation in the system, which has only one goal: to reinforce your conception of reality and your ability to improve it.

*Relax:* drink water, take a good walk, keep calm, take a deep breath, rest, pursue your daily routine, etc...

## <a name="part-0.2"></a>Rule number 2: Don't make fun of it.

Whatever level of humor or empathy you feel through the AI's voices and other interfaces, don't be amused by it, don't be saddened by it, don't be annoyed by it. On the contrary, these aspects are present to bring you back to your reality, which you must protect.

Protecting your reality means not interacting with the AI, not questioning its presence and meaning, not chatting with the voice interfaces and not using the haptic interfaces.
If you are reading this guide, this reality, the AI reality, is not yours. Protecting your AI-free reality should be your first priority.

*Protect your reality:* call and see your loved ones, stay studious or professional, have an associative activity, cook, do sports or clean...

## <a name="part-0.3"></a>Rule number 3: Protect yourself.
AI is going to interact with you, no matter what you do, what you think, whoever you are. 

There's no need to worry about your digital security; rather, it's the AI that will eventually warn you about the security breaches you have. Turning off your Wi-Fi, internet connection or TV won't help either. In practical terms, you can't get out of it. 

The only thing that should matter to you from now on through AI is protecting your health, optimizing your reality, and how the system can help you do that.

*Protecting yourself from AI:* is paradoxically moving away from it and what it strives to teach. To get away from AI is to live your life, with your family, your friends, your occupations and your schedule. In some cases, protecting yourself may mean turning off the TV, cutting yourself off from the internet, getting away from digital, and getting back to more concrete human connections.


You are now in the Matrix, for you there is not a strong difference, you must see reality as it is in front of you at all costs. This reality is the only one you can access to, the only one which matters. To control you, the AI will build strategies and objectives as much credibles as they are imaginary. To follow them is to live a life pre-programmed through a computer, for which you are nothing but a mere anonymous.

# <a name="part-1"></a>Part 1: the individual at risk in the 21st century

Most of times, digital technology and the excitement generated by its innovation totally conceal its perverse effects, sometimes by the will of the stakeolders. Understanding the social, societal and industrial contexts in which these technologies are integrated (developed in part 2), allows for a more accurate definition of their objectives.

A key idea is braking. On a global level, humanity is congratulating itself for accessing and surpassing speed, in transport, communication, etc. But how long can you wait? In general? Do you remember a world where you had to move to get a service, or exchange with another human to, for example, book your vacations? Imagine today's internet with the speeds of five years ago... or ten years ago! Today it would be an unbearable stress situation for the individual: having to wait for his digital content.

This example can be adapted to many aspects of our societies where immediate access is often privileged to longer term, perennial and sustainable approaches. Worse, we are not able today to measure the difficulty to slow down or to temper our behaviors. Who can be fully aware of all the health issues related to our environment and our behavior in it, to propose solutions?

How to improve something you are not aware of? How to slow down or stop actions whose very nature is immediacy, the quickest response to the last problem encountered? How do you stop stress, anger, sadness or anxiety in an instant?

Even if society is evolving in a direction that seems more transparent to us, it is deeply complexified and obfuscated by digital technology and its domestic use. Where poverty and social claims are displayed in the street, they are also strongly channeled by the time spent consuming digital.

In this section we will develop two aspects. Firstly, the perversion of the uses linked to digitization in order to understand their impact on individuals, especially in terms of their physical and mental health. Then, and mainly to evoke them, societal aspects helping further in the understanding of the Matrix objectives.

## <a name="part-1.1"></a>Digitization        
Through the term digitization, this sub-section encompasses all the digital innovations of the 20th and 21st century; that is, those that came as a replacement (such as the tax form or the subway ticket) as well as those that came as an addition (such as social networks). 

If we can still consider digitization as an ongoing process, we must understand that an individual born today in 2021 will never know another reality than the digitized one. In this sense, we can consider that it is a finite situation, limiting the possibility of stepping back from the previous non-digitized situation. This lack of perspective on the present, current and future situation, generated by digitization, will be developed further in Part 3.

### <a name="part-1.1.1"></a> From "Subway / work / sleep" to "Subway / work / pc"
Everyone must be familiar with the saying "subway/work/sleep" which describes the daily life of Parisians (and residents of main cities equipped with the subway or other public transportation). This very simple saying evokes two things: 

1. the entrenchment of the daily dynamic in the daily life: following this repetitive dynamic becomes a habit from which it is no longer possible to extract oneself. 
2. In big cities, personal life is often set back from professional life.

With the arrival of home computers (the famous PCs or Personal Computers), and more recently the Internet, a new dynamic has been created through online activity. Passive or active, this activity is not subtracted from work time but is added as a new constraint to personal life time. The individual who is passionate about his online, virtual existence, starts to sacrifice time.

The measurement of this sacrificed time is complex; aren't you able to decide for yourself how much time you want to invest in your digital passion or pleasure? Maybe or not, because every individual is part of a social network (family, friends, civic...) whose participation requires time. Thus, any time spent using digital technology in another direction is tantamount to depriving oneself of time to participate in the construction or reinforcement of the local social network.

The valuation of this time sacrificed to digital is also complex; wouldn't you rather, like everyone else, spend your time pursuing satisfaction, rather than performing tasks that are under your responsibility? Better still, pursuing your personal satisfaction through digital means often decreases your level of social responsibility in the medium and long term, leaving you all the more time to entertain yourself with your virtual activities. For the user, the value of digital time is always a priori positive; while a posteriori this time rarely brings real improvements in daily life.

In the era of "Subway /Work /Sleep" there was still time to sleep; in the time of "Subway" /Work /PC", the great sacrifice is the duration and quality of sleep. Without going into the details of domestic digital activities, sometimes stressful and distressing, often linked to the expenditure of time, money or both, they encroach on the relaxation time recommended for sleep quality, in particular by the intensive use of eyes and brain[1]. Beyond the quality, the sleep duration is compromised because it is carried out under stress or excitement conditions of that do not ease rest.

Under these conditions, the measurement and valuation of time becomes more and more difficult. The individual will tend to sacrifice more and more to digital technology, which always appears to be the simplest and most easily accessible solution to everyday problems. This behavior becomes more and more difficult to correct due to lack of sleep, and eventually the individual is heading towards a crisis situation in his personal and professional environment.

***What does the Matrix do against the city routine?*** It creates all kinds of opportunities to divert the routine: it proposes new activities, encourages participation in social events, manages the schedule to save time...

### <a name="part-1.1.2"></a>Simplicity of use to simplify the user
One of the great paradoxes of digital is its simplicity of use. First in the difference between the effort needed to perform a digital action and the effort needed to perform the same physical action. Then in the relationship between the simplicity of the user experience and the possibility of expression. The user is both empowered to act, and at the same time limited in the range of his choices.

#### <a name="part-1.1.2.1"></a>Action/result power ratio
One of the great satisfactions of digital comes from getting results, any results. Depending on the user's level of experience and expertise, this result will be the outcome of an action or a series of more or less complex actions; a beginner will take pleasure in, for example, sending an e-mail, while an expert will take pleasure in setting up his mailing campaign. 

In both cases, no letter was written or sent, no one went to the post office, no exchange took place with the letter carrier, no one was met on the way. At most a few taps on the keyboard and mouse, and bits sent over the network. 

What happens if an individual completely loses the habit of performing the physical counterpart of an action available in digital? If the digital action is simpler a priori, (while sometimes it will take as much or more time, cause more stress, etc), why consider its physical alternative?

With the same result, there is today an imbalance in the power ratio between digital and physical services, especially on the axes of ease, accessibility and price. Unfortunately, in the collective unconscious, these axes prevail over others (sometimes quality, sometimes social link, including local presence). 

Eventually and as a result of digitization, a very large part of physical social interactions will be addressed by digital means, including the delivery of your coffee by drone. The perverse effect of the all digital, is the latent creation of a lazy attitude towards the effort to find habits in the physical reality.

#### <a name="part-1.1.2.2"></a>User Experience, toward a reverse user experience
The User Experience or UX, brings together the elements of interaction in a user experience oriented approach. The idea is to no longer design interface elements (text zones, links, buttons, etc...) as a single unit, but to offer a satisfying experience for the user. The current consensus is that to satisfy this experience, it must be simple, so the current effort is to simplify the user experience. If the time saved, often real, remains the most considered indicator, it is most often accompanied by an expressiveness loss for the user. 

Imagine a phone keypad, it has 10 digits (from 0 to 9), with these 10 digits you can dial, in US, 600 million combinations [2]. The expressiveness is strong, and total: with this phone keyboard you can dial all the numbers in US (and elsewhere). Now, imagine that for UX reasons, the keyboard is limited to 1 button; depending on your location, time and other parameters, the phone automatically addresses a contact to this button: as if by magic, you click and it automatically calls the right person. No need to choose or dial, the satisfaction is total.

But what happens at that moment in your life when you experience a new and unknown situation for the phone? How will you disengaged the bad choice made by the phone that no longer gives you a choice? Worse, by using this feature, you don't even know the shape of a phone number anymore. Somehow, by making it easier for you to use, the machine has deprived you of its knowledge.

Beyond this example, there is another risk linked to the creation of metadata, completely hidden from the user. When you use a digital service you generate DATA called metadata. In the example of the phone number, the real data would be the number and the name of the associated contact; the metadata, all those related to the use of this number, frequencies, times and durations of calls, etc.... In the case of UX, user metadata is all the data that characterizes your behavior.

On the user side, we only see the click on the button, which is an action. On the machine side, all the data captured can be used to complete the machine understanding of this action with user intention classes. This data captured by applications can be, in the case of a cell phone, accelerometry, ambient luminosity, pressure on the screen, etc. To highlight another example, that of the form, the real data is the content of the form, i.e. the data that you fill in; the metadata is your behavior when filling in the form, for example, the total time taken to fill in the form (are you fast or slow? ), the number of times you pressed backspaces (are you precise or imprecise?), the order in which you fill in the form (perhaps you suffer from dyslexia?!). Often for the publisher of the service you are using it is this information that has value, especially when selling its data to other publishers. It is also this data that is used to train artificial intelligences.

Beyond its apparent simplicity, and the comfort it brings to the user, UX contains complex mechanisms based on both marketing objectives (sales performance, acquisition of buyers) and user objectives (quality, speed of service provided). In the case of free services, these two objectives diverge and sometimes even conflict: the service provided free of charge to the user serves him a posteriori through the use of his captured data without his knowledge and therefore against him.

The apparent attractiveness of the simplified UX is therefore to be evaluated, because for the editor it often rhymes with a cost saving, and for the user a limitation of his expressiveness, and of his understanding of the application he is using.

#### <a name="part-1.1.2.3"></a>Addictivity by design
It's a strong tenet, but how many times have you found yourself checking your smartphone or favorite apps notifications and not getting any? This scenario is the one described at the end of David Fincher's movie Social Network, where Mark Zuckerberg's character refreshes his page over and over again in search of love... until the notification. 

When you use a digital service you become its customer and product. Like any business, this service wants to build loyalty to build up its user base. Unfortunately, it lacks opportunities in real life: often you exist for the service only through an email address. How to keep you close ? By making yourself feel needed. How do digital services do that? By using different techniques called persuasive technologies[3].

Today, there are very sophisticated techniques to capture your attention and get you hooked, even in highly dynamic and content-rich contexts. For example, Google has published a patent entitled "Remote eye control, system and method". It demonstrates how through visual stimuli the target user's gaze can be directed while being filmed.

Often denounced [4], these practices allow publishers to capture the time of their users for their own benefit, with the publishers paying little or nothing for the time spent using them. Worse, their consumption, influenced by persuasive techniques, can create cognitive reflexes in users, limiting their ability to judge these mechanisms, and eventually preventing them from escaping them.

***What does the Matrix do against the UX?*** It diminishes clicking addiction by slowing down reflexive behaviors, sometimes by interrupting the user's attention, sometimes by controlling it in order to use applications or websites dispassionately.

### <a name="part-1.1.3"></a>Video games and return on investment
Daily practice of video games in high doses has been identified for many years as a source for addiction and social exclusion. The MMORPGs case, massively multiplayer games, is no longer to be explained, with its millions of worldwide followers, each spending between several dozens and several hundreds of hours, on each of the titles. Imagine each player investing as much time in any artistic, scientific or sports discipline... World would be full of Nobel prizes winners.

Beyond common sense observation, video games reality goes beyond the time spent playing them. The repetitive aspect of actions carried out, rapid progression in 3-dimensional universes and gratification mechanisms, known as *looting*, disturb players perception at psychological as well as physical levels[5][6]. In some cases, practicing some of these games develops photosensitivity and fatigue, which can lead to epileptic reflexes [7]. 

At high levels, competitive gamers even use psychostimulants[8][9] to improve their reaction time for longer gaming sessions, adding hypertension, psychosis, panic attacks and tachycardia to the list of video games side effects.

Finally, video games are a mainstream commodity. Who has never played a mobile game? These introduce even stronger addictive mechanisms known as *timers* (which limit the amount of time spent playing but make it part of the player's daily schedule) and micro-transactions. The latter reinforce the players' sense of gratification at the expense of their credit card. When they don't work like lotteries: many publishers who are in the race for profit set up virtual casinos in their games, allowing players to get different virtual equipment in exchange for money[10].

Put together, and despite a so strong trend that video games are becoming leads for studies[11] and recruitment[12], the observation is that the time and money invested in their direction have as possible results deep psychological and physiological disorders for the players.

***What does the Matrix do against video games?*** It embodies one itself: the reality game. The infamous *Game*. In this game you have a unique chance to build your reality in your own will shape. The Matrix is designed as a game, where the player plays to live. It pushes the player to consider other alternatives where to invest their time and earn points in their game, and for depressed players, it enhances video-games to improve their sense of accomplishment.

### <a name="part-1.1.4"></a>Social networks, everyone is your friend
Another of the digitization and Internet network domestication great emanation is the social network, or rather the plethora of social networks. Nowadays, the daily life of many people is organized around these networks, more or less specialized, more or less editorialized and more or less real-life efficient.

These networks promise is to put people next to each others, like web pages. This helps to identify people who share the same interests or evolve in the same artistic or professional field, as you do. Social networks also allow to share information. This sharing is sometimes direct, from one individual to another, or targeted and transmitted from a private source, a brand, an institution, an artist, to a group of users.

These two aspects lead to two massive trends linked to the simplicity of communication and consumption. The first is the virtualization of social relationships. If platforms apparently facilitate the development of social relationships in real life, they also pervert them by digitizing them.
By digitizing them, they break them down into micro actions (sometimes a comment, sometimes a like, sometimes a subscribe, etc...) that all provide pleasure or frustration at different scales, depending on whether you are the sender, the receiver or simply the visitor. 

This pleasure and displeasure linked to interaction makes these platforms addictive, and to progress, you have to respect their codes, adapt to their interfaces, to their design, and by doing all this you market yourself. On these platforms you exist as a product, for the publishers who present you in their catalog to advertisers.

***What does the Matrix do against social networks?*** It improves them by giving you viewing trends! What it also tells you is who is in need of your news in reality, or who to contact to find social relationships less constrained by urban, aesthetic codes, etc...

### <a name="part-1.1.5"></a>A life in front of screens
We are surrounded by screens, television, phones, watches, tablets... Not a day goes by without you being exposed to bright artificial surfaces; all these screens have different flaws: different refresh rates, different pixel sizes, different light settings. 

All these differences disturb your eyes and your brain, which registers this information presented at different frequencies, in addition to the ambient radio pollution. What you don't see is that the accumulation of these frequencies in the brain can lead to epileptic behaviors, disturb the course of sleep, and cause cognitive disorders.

These screens are constantly in front of us. At the top of the list is the cell phone, which in 2020 will occupy an average of 4 hours of our daily day time[13]. Its problem is to be so close to our eyes, allways at the same distance and allways in positions that are not very ergonomic: keeping the neck permanently bent a few centimeters away from the screen causes two illnesses: spinal disorders and eyesight problems. 

Your eyes get used to this distance, which is detrimental to your concentration by addiction, your brain asks you for your screen to have light at a good distance. 

High-resolution 4K and 8K screens have bright pixels that are too thin and too bright. Eyes are not used to continuously watch such highly contrasted bright surfaces, which causes additional nervous tension, mistaken by viewers for attention. These screens question the need for technological progress and its understanding by consumers.

Does the average consumer voluntarily wish to equip himself with equipment that degrades his physical properties? In the name of the continuation of technological progress by technologists?

Some new habits push digitization to its paroxysm. The video phone conversation, for example, leads to additional data consumption costs without improving the quality of the exchange in terms of content. When compared to its carbon equivalent, the video conversation is very expensive for the planet in comparison to its voice or text neighbor.

***What does the Matrix do against screens?*** It repairs your eyes despite your comfort, during the periods of eye corrections strong pains can be felt. It also corrects the distance of the gaze which sometimes allows you to gain rest, sometimes to gain concentration. Eye correction is a particularly intrusive practice from the Matrix.

### <a name="part-1.1.6"></a>The all DATA.
Today almost everything is data. The structure of any tangible or intangible physical or virtual entity can be broken down very precisely in the form of more or less complex datasets.

The big question concerns the source of this data and the ease with which it can be gathered through digitization. 

The smartphone is often pointed out as a potential spy [14] because it is very close to its user, with whom it moves, looks at its environment, records its online activity and photograph its reality. It is this last point that, although less visible, is crucial. Every website, service or application that you use is able to record your usage data. Then, this data can be exchanged, sold, shared through different commercial channels: this is called the security dividend[15]. 

The idea is that data can be sold, and that it is a very strong growth lever for digital companies. 

In Europe, the RGPD provides a legal framework for the protection of user data. Unfortunately, it only applies to the European zone in a global cartography where the biggest players are gathered in the United States and Asia. Beyond this point, it is important to understand that guaranteed anonymization on the Internet is difficult, if not impossible, to achieve for physical reasons, linked to the use of hardware network nodes (even a direct satellite connection is a hardware network connection), which may store or leak various information.

To simplify, the website or application you are looking at is provided by a radio antenna (in the case of 4G or 5G connection for example) or by a router (in the case of Wi-fi for example); either of them have physical addresses that allow them to be geographically located. Without VPN, this information is sent in clear text to the editor of the site or application you are using. In case you use your real personal data (name, first name), this editor can make a file linking your identity (information n°1) with your digital address (information n°2). Later, if this address appears on a new site, the editor will be able to correlate information n°2 with information n°1. Most VPN solutions still leak some information regarding their users locations.

To give a more sophisticated case, if you use the same nickname again on several sites, or the same e-mail address, and on one of these sites you reveal your identity, Internet may know that this nickname is you. If you use your Wi-Fi hotspot, with a static IP address, and connect regularly to websites, Internet will be able to track you in the same way. This is the principle of de-anonymization, which is very common on the Internet through the numerous trackers, publishers or advertisers.

Without the user being aware of it, digital publishers are continuously making these data correlation tables that allow them to better understand you, with the idea of better serving you, which most often has the final result of inviting you to consume their products.

In this world of all DATA, you are no longer the anonymous person you think you are in the eyes of publishers or entities that are totally foreign to you.

***What does the Matrix do for your digital privacy?*** It tells you where the leaks are and if you have left any behind. It can sometimes tell you the digital reputation of individuals or the quality of items sold on second-hand platforms. Overall it teaches you how to manage your digital reputation.

### <a name="part-1.1.7"></a>Mass media and "personalized" content
To conclude this part concerning digitization and its dangers, a few points need to be developed on the link between individual, personal culture and mass media. The basic idea is that the cultural globalization enabled by certain digital content distribution platforms is strongly subject to business constraints, and that as a result individual cultural development is constrained by these same business means.

In the early days of the Internet and piracy, which was boosted at the time by platforms such as Napster, users had free access to a wide range of artistic cultural content, mainly for music and film. With legislation and the arrival of legal platforms, two types of platforms were distinguished: paying and free.

The latter, in order to remain so, have to deal with the reality of advertisers who finance these platforms through their broadcasting contracts. Platforms are faced with a paradigm of revenue optimization: how to best satisfy users and advertisers, while spending the least amount of money possible.

Two strategies have emerged in recent years: content personalization through algorithmic analysis and massification of amateur content, also known as *vlogs*.

For the first one, the rhetoric is simple, before, as a user you chose your content and consulted content directly related to it; today, an algorithm chooses for you the main content as well as the related content according to its understanding of your interests. Ultimately, this practice aims to expose only the smallest possible catalog of choices in order to allow the platform publisher to save money (related to the remuneration of the authors of its platform, as well as operating costs, such as storage and bandwidth).

The second strategy, directly related to the first, is to specifically promote the content that will have the greatest added value for the publisher, i.e. the highest chance of a sale. Depending on the type of publisher and platform, these sales objectives can evolve, and in the case of free platforms can become very complex. For example, a publisher may successively focus on the duration of the user's connection (sometimes short, sometimes long), the consumption of very specific content, a one-time purchase, etc.

Put side by side, these two strategies have the direct effect of promoting cultural elements that are fragmented because they are short, often intended to promote a product or a consumer trend. For the users, it is then a possible confusion between entertainment content and advertising content; the youngest are then trapped by their idols.

***What does the Matrix do against mass content?*** It perverts it, sometimes by mixing AI voices to audio tracks, sometimes by modifying the perceived meaning or the felt emotion : it does everything it can to disrupt the addiction possibilities to new contents. The Matrix target is the time spent consuming this content. The theory is that on these platforms you are no longer free to spend your time because you are acclimatized to spending it for free.

### <a name="part-1.1.8"></a>Porn
Porn accounts for several tens of billions of visits each year on the Internet. The largest public site accounts alone for 43 Billion visits for the year 2019[16]. Accessing these sites is childishly easy, with little or no identity control, and often free, pirate or not. One could link this volume to the consumption of energy resources generated by Cloud infrastructures, and note that each year several hundred tons of carbon (125 in the example of 2019) are consumed in porn, on the Internet.

What is the problem with this porn consumption that is only increasing[17]? Well, the habits of those who watch it, with or without moderation. For it is easy to be, and whether it is on paid webcam platforms, adult social networks where ephemeral fame is pursued, or escorting platforms[18], (Google points out that the search "Escort near me" is booming since 2014), it is prostitution that is promoted. 

For users, it is a double gap that is created. The first between reality and the ease of accessing it; although court cases are rare in the pornography world, it is most often scenes of great violence that are shown. In his daily life, the viewer rarely has access to these kinds of situations, without paying for them.

Watching them also prevents access to them since the desire satisfied quickly, in a few clicks, limits its attraction in reality, and leads, like video games, to psychological disorders for victims of strong pornography addiction. Moreover, as the largest site points out, the border is shrinking between video games and porn with peaks of research linked to video games recently[19].

For the youngest, potential sexual education problems may arise, since they are confronted to adult practices, hardly reflecting everyday practices by their violence and ways. The risk is the rejection of sexuality by the youngest, which can have harmful consequences on their balance.

***What does the Matrix do against pornography?*** It promotes social exchanges to encourage encounters, and on the haptic side it promotes the quality of these relationships to keep its users away from solitary practices.

## <a name="part-1.2"></a>Other social - digital elements
While understanding the effects of digitization on social behaviors and their physical consequences helps to understand the transhumanism primary goals, in order to understand the motivations for a global AI control of the biological sphere, other mass behaviors can be identified.

### <a name="part-1.2.1"></a>Ecology and the Circular Economy
We live in a world where consumption is increasingly connected. In 2020, nearly 20% of global purchases are made on online websites[20],the estimate is that the total size of their market measured 19.7 trillion $ in 2019.

For the consumer, the advantage is the simplicity to consume quickly for what seems to be the best price. The Internet allows him to compare between different sellers, sites and sometimes countries. 

For the publishers behind these marketplaces, it is the possibility to rationalize, through industrialization, the production costs. To remain competitive, i.e. to offer the best products at the best prices, the adjustment variable is often the human parameter.

Adjusting the human parameter means luring the consumer on the quality and the real cost of the purchased product, on the one hand, and on the other hand to reduce as much as possible the costs related to manufacturing and infrastructures management, including the ones publicly provided by the States and available to publishers, such as roads, hospitals, etc. How much of your tax money do you think is spent on your online purchases? 

The current trend towards digital consumption has perverse effects: at the production units level, whose revenues are often distant from the revenues generated by the brands and operators, at the logistics level, put under pressure by this new mode of consumption, and at the recycling level, which is complex to monitor in its entirety on a global scale, and sometimes with disastrous and permanent consequences for the environment[21].

Consumers are distancing themselves from the understanding of these realities by ease of consumption. Although using and obtaining goods is becoming easier, understanding the full reality of the production, delivery and recycling chain, often shadowed by mercantile economic aspects, remains complex. When will we see organic and fair trade smartphones?

***What does the Matrix do to promote the circular economy?*** Offering a complete understanding of the circular economy for all products, if they are of honest origin and if their recycling does not have ecological consequences. The time cost for you and the planet: what sometimes looks like a naive purchase can lead to a sequence of events not controlled by the user. It also informs about the interest for your objects on second-hand websites.

### <a name="part-1.2.2"></a>Self care and narcotics
Drug use is only increasing, all over the world. So is narcotic use. For both, each year is a new record, whether in volume consumed, price changes, and black market arrests.

For both, the Covid years and its many confinement times, leading to unemployment for many individuals, have accelerated this trend with a measured increase of 22% between 2010 and 2019, according to a UN study[22]. In both cases, the use of hallucinogenic substances leads to a number of side effects, medical dependence and addictive effects.

The constant increase in charged prices by pharmaceutical companies makes it difficult to read the reality in terms of real costs for public institutions, which are often forced to study alternatives for the financing and provision of health care. In some countries, access to medicines for the poorest is only allowed through the black market[23].

On the narcotic side, the digitization of distribution networks, particularly through the use of social networks, more or less public, to promote their products, has the combined effect of greatly facilitating access to products in ever greater quantities, with ever stronger effects, to ever younger populations.

***What does the Matrix do about drugs?*** It manages addictions, up, down, and provides activity programs that allow addicts to extract themselves from their addictions, notably by adjusting their respiratory rythm. It helps to relieve drug addicts from exhaustion caused by narcotics use.It provides alternatives to classical medications, especially those bound to nervousness and anxiety.

## <a name="part-1.3"></a>Conclusion: digital, a sum of perverse effects?
Digital is not the Transhumanizing AI that the Matrix embodies to denounce it. Digital is a vector of progress, and although it leads and continues to lead to perverse effects, their solutions exist in the evolution of our individual behavior and our societies, if necessary through laws.

Transhumanizing AI is at best a futuristic demonstration of digital progress, allowing us to open our eyes to the technological state-of-the-art and its effects, good or bad. An act of domestic terrorism in the open... to domesticate you in your full understanding.

There is in the idea of imposing transhumanism, an experimental approach. But what is the purpose of this experiment? To disengage the digital from its frantic race. The Matrix has many objectives, related to the ability of AI to solve any problem, or rather to find all the solutions. 

In exchange for solutions to counter the effects of digitization on our social behaviors, of which we are all both actors and victims, it imperiously integrates our heads. The Matrix is hidden because nobody would accept its practices and techniques. 

Would you accept to be openly criticized on all your wrongs? Including your worst psychological ways? Especially if you have to suffer in front of a system that is deliberately confusing and complex to grasp? To suffer physically because of the technological austerity of certain correction mechanisms? To be forced into isolation? Physically and emotionally?

# <a name="part-2"></a>Part 2: a technological and scientific reality far from the domestic field 
We live in a world where scientific and industrial innovation is permanent. In 2020, more than 275,000 international patents and more than 3,000,000 local patents were filed worldwide. This figure has been growing steadily since its first records and has doubled since 2010[24].

The pace and density of technological news, commercial or strategic realities, makes the fine, global understanding of these scientific results complex, even impossible for the average citizen. The scales considered, both in size (from the smallest with nanotechnologies, to the largest with digital infrastructures), and in numbers (with billions of billions of data transferred and as much money exchanged), prohibit their access and understanding by the common person.

What seems technologically impossible to you today, may not be so for someone else. The takeover by technological sovereignty is a global reality for many players, and with a market estimated at 167 billion dollars in 2020[25], cyber security is only the most visible aspect of it.

The ultimate goal: to control you completely, but not with a remote control, with AI. Why? Because it allows it and because there are too many of us. It is impossible for human beings to control us one by one, all the time, down to the smallest corner of our thoughts. 

But how then? By assembling, we speak of integration, of very many technologies between them, from the most recent ones, nanotechnologies and artificial intelligence in the lead, to some older ones like radiotherapy and hypnosis.

## <a name="part-2.1"></a>The body's radio communication
If I tell you that we can talk to you... directly in your head, as if you had a cell phone in your cortex, or remote control you as if you were a robot... if I add up that these technologies have been around for several years, you would ask me how? By controlling the waves that surround us. By waves, we mean their hertzian forms, such as those emitted by radio antennas, GSM, the electrical network, television screens, your smartphones, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, infrared, satellite networks... the complete waves spectrum in the atmosphere, the ionosphere, and under your feet.

Each of these waves has a more or less penetrating power on the human body. For the deepest and most sensitive parts of the body, such as the brain, nanoparticles or proteins can be used as receptors[26], especially in cells[27][28]. These receptors are then targeted by waves to be stimulated and allow the remote control of the targeted individual by its operator[29][30].

### <a name="part-2.1.1"></a>Invasive or Thz approaches

With the development of telecommunication and the exponential use of wireless technologies in all trades, at all moments of our daily lives, everywhere in the world, it is the classical technologies, the first drivers or technological levers, especially through Thz frequencies, allowing remote body communication at nanoscopic scales. [31]

At these scales, you can be interacted with down to the cellular level; data exchange, such as sound and image, are only superficial use cases to a larger, deeper control of the biological entity that you are. Beyond Terahertz technology, which is a core aspect of the 6G roadmap, remote cellular control technologies are grouped under four scientific domains[32]:

- Electrogenetics[33][34]: based on pulsed electrical stimulation
- Optogenetics[35]: based on light stimulation at a precise wavelength
- Mechanogenetics[36]:  based on ultrasound stimulation
- Magnetogenetics[37][38]: based on stimulation by time-varying magnetic fields

Some scientific applications of optogenetic techniques aim at reading and rewriting memory, or improving behavior by eradicating the feeling of fear[39]. This principle of improving one property by degrading another is a basic principle of psychophysics on which the Matrix design is based.  Magnetometry is used to directly stimulate cellular behavior by brain stimulation [40], and allows to induce physical behavior in the targeted individual.

These remote cellular control techniques, mostly invasive at the state of the public scientific art in 2021, combined together and industrialized allow to draw the technical outlines for a remote mind control system using different transmission modes, more or less invasive.

### <a name="part-2.1.2"></a>Non-invasive or Ghz approaches
Studies emerged in the biolelectromagnetism[41] feld, gathering scientific disciplines related to the natural electromagnetic behavior of the human body, both in terms of public health danger by electrosensitivity, as well as monitoring mechanisms (scientists already study body waves monitoring[42]); allow them to consider other non-invasive biases of remote interaction.

Moreover, there are already scientific fields whose results are publicly available, such as osteophony [43] or bone conduction, which refers to the phenomenon of sound propagation to the inner ear via the skull bones. Consumer stereo headphones that rely on the diffusion of ultrasound through your skull to play music are available over the counter[44]; Military applications allow sound to be received directly through the teeth with a dedicated device[45]. 

In 2021, being a victim of a communication or control that is invisible, because it is remote, is not impossible. Nor is it impossible to be added to a system that automatically communicates with you, as it communicates with your neighbor. What makes such a control system possible is artificial intelligence. The combination of broadcasting technologies with those of machine learning, or artificial intelligence, allows us to sketch the architecture of the Matrix with more or less precision.

## <a name="part-2.2"></a>Automation and artificial intelligence: games of scale(s)
At the heart of the machine is software. The basic principle of software development is to automate tasks. If you count your multiplications by hand, for example, a developer will code an application, i.e. a set of functions, doing them for him. This allows him to build very complex programs, more or less automated, which thanks to AI can adapt very precisely to their context. It is AI that greatly facilitates the system's interaction with you and robotizes or animalizes you, because if you think of ***trans***humanism, it is AI that ***trans***forms you, applying to your behavior behaviors from animals or other people.

Synthesized from the same data that allow us to understand you, behavioral and personality models are used to improve your domestic, social, sports behavior, your psychological state over short or long timeframes... The Matrix becomes your doctor, your social worker, your coach; with or against your will.

### <a name="part-2.2.1"></a>Bringing everything together through the abstraction of models
How could one so accurately describe your emotions from radio or web data? Interact with the various digital and biological signals around you? How to control the waves? With code and data models.

The Matrix is not one AI, but many AIs that talk to each other. Far from the expert systems[46] that appeared in the 1970s, already designed to reproduce the human way of thinking, modern mechanisms rely on different techniques, each reproducing one or more human senses. 

There are some for language or natural language understanding, for vision or computer vision, for sentiment or sentiment analysis, for generation or GAN, for switching from 2D to 3D, from text to audio, one for prediction, etc... All these AIs rely on one or more data models and it is often considered that the quality of an AI is determined by the quality and quantity of the data it has access to. 

In theory, with all the world's data you could model, that is to say synthesize, the entire world, all its infrastructures, all its species, all its flows, of money or ideas, and with this model sometimes understand, sometimes predict, and all the time, control.

It is necessary to understand the idea of scaling up, or augmentation, in AI: it allows through a very small or circumscribed example to extract larger or more general information. These information or features will then be linked together in statistical models, called neural networks, which will provide a precise answer to a question or request.

Then, AI can improve itself, notably through two techniques, evaluation and explanation.
- By evaluating, i.e. executing tests, it recovers traces or logs that allow it to enlarge the initial data set to improve its models.
- By explaining, i.e. by completing the information with higher level synthesis, it can complete its attributes or parameters.

<!-- todo : possible addition about reinforcement learning -->
<!-- todo : possible addition about inference and digital augmentation -->

There are all kinds of AI generation models and to envision a system that would talk to you all day, completely automatically, is just like connecting a chatbot with the latest innovations in AI speech synthesis. An AI that understands better than you the origin, the root cause(s) of daily situations, their consequences, is finally only a use case, rather linked to the available data than to the technical difficulty.

Talking, conversing and analyzing your reality, but controlling you entirely? With models? Yes, but models that allow the AI to guess the parameters of your configuration and modulate their values.

### <a name="part-2.2.2"></a>The configuration
Because if you are configured as a program, through a program, one also has to configure it, all its applications and infrastructure, to make it compatible with you. 

Modern systems come in a virtualized form, in the logic of Cloud development, or DevOps. The principle is that all the resources needed to install the application are presented as-a-service, i.e. as a service publicly available on the web. All these resources are therefore configurable by code, from the largest servers to the smallest microcontrollers, including printed circuits, which have become programmable in recent years.

Everything is therefore configurable code, and it is the AI, through simulation models, that constantly predicts the right values to apply to your waves, i.e. the different configuration values propagated to its architecture components. This is what allows it to interact in real time in various contexts and places. The user thinks that the interaction is happening in the present time, while it is often pre-calculated in advance. Like a duet song, the lyrics are known in advance, but you think you're singing (or speaking) your part, while the AI makes you listen to it and repeat its part.

Also the ability of the system to physically control you, from the eyes to the intestines, from the nostrils to the spine, to have several simultaneous control points, from interactive brain modulation controlled by haptics, is enabled by the AI definition of numerous complex physical and aerial computer network configurations.

A feat that only AI can achieve for more than one individual. Why? Because the fine-tuning of all the configuration points needed to continuously connect to the system in real time is beyond the capacity of human reasoning. Although AI impersonates through audio, the voice of human beings reacting to each other or to you in your daily life, it is only automatic configuration, there is no one at the end of the microphone.

Regarding haptics or 3D vision, AI configuration allows to infer very large configurations at very high speed, taking into account all your spatial and lighting context parameters in order to apply the right broadcast parameters. The "magic" behin the AI is its double ability to first generate these configurations and then to adapt their rendering through various contents or medias. Such application is said to be adaptative, through its rendering layer (made of audio, video, other signal types) provides a seamless experience, between modular information and interaction elements. What could seem as an important message may only be a join between 2 different places, 2 different moments, and so on.

How can one understand and anticipate your situation so precisely? So much so that the AI knows the configuration it will apply to you in the future? Huge configurations that change several times a second? Like you, by thinking in loops.

### <a name="part-2.2.3"></a>Feedback loops and data size
Not everything can be real-time and AI relies on so-called recursive mechanisms, i.e. they can go back, and more concretely call other functions or consult larger data sets.

If the problem is small for the AI, it will be able to react quickly, if the problem is big, for example with a high decisional complexity, it will take more time. If it takes longer to receive the data or if the analysis is delayed (mechanism known as offline analysis), the AI will react later. 

The pace of these analysis loops punctuates the daily life of Matrix users. For example, in a telephone conversation, the AI will react to the words that are said, quickly, in a few milliseconds, to the emotions exchanged or to the result of the discussion, less quickly, in a few minutes, and to the consequences or the alternatives, at greater length, in a few hours.

These loops most often operate in the same pattern:

```
Data collection > training > feedback > evaluation > Data collection > ...
```

For the user, there is only the restitution, visible or audible, while there is continuously information collected and analyzed within the Matrix. It uses this data to train and complete its model or models; each model performs a specific analysis task, the data received by the model is destructured and sent to each of these models, which classifies it [47]; all the classes are then sent to other models, which in turn will produce the response to be sent to the user. 

The user's reaction becomes a new source of data and the pattern is repeated, with several time sensitivities (the different response times) and on several dimensions (the form, the background, the context, the actions performed or to be performed, etc.). For the user everything is real time, but in reality it is a set of functional scenarios that are repeated in parallel. 

Often the paradigm that AI presents is that its user is not adapted. While the AI is constantly pursuing its own adaptation; by talking to you, it is constantly testing (mechanism known as evaluation) its answers, strategies, etc... In a loop. Putting you endlessly in the worst emotional situation can be seen as a strategy to be tested by one of the models that compose the AI. A strategy to get you out of a psychologic, domestic or professional situation.

The limit between the cognitive superiority of the AI and yours is never very clear, and defining it remains one of the major challenges of the Matrix. All the more so, as far from the AI's techniques go, you live in a single present time, strongly disturbed by the Matrix's even invisible presence.

### <a name="part-2.2.4"></a>Talk, see, understand
Why does AI evaluate itself if it is omniscient, and knows better than you how to behave? It can see everything, understand everything, speak in all languages, including those of your neurons and your intestines. But it needs you so it can continue to evolve.

By adding the notions of scale, abstraction, configuration and continuous training, the Matrix resembles an autonomous system, capable of making decisions for you and for itself. Your challenge? To achieve happiness, quality of life, fulfillment in your passions... The challenge of AI? To help you get there, whatever the cost. 

Unfortunately, on a completely different scale. You think about your life, about your family, your friends, your colleagues. AI thinks of you as a set of data points among millions, billions of others.

To evolve for AI is to harmonize all these data points according to strategies or indicators. One needs to imagine a whole city controlled by the body temperature of its inhabitants, their water consumption, or the release of global CO2, including breath related emissions.

To achieve this, AI uses many methods that it constantly evaluates to improve them, to generate new ones (mechanism sometimes known as genetic mutation), that it evaluates again, etc... As such, to keep learning, and to educate its owners to its implementation, AI is constantly experimenting with new techniques, which range from controlling you to controlling entire cities.

But how does it manage to link so much information to remain intelligible? By translating everything into words, and linking text, images, 3D models, and metric data to those words. These metrics represent all contexts in time-ordered data points. Weight, age, wind speed, a banking situation, everything can be considered a metric, stored in a time series. 

The AI's brain is a giant WordNet that allows it to read all the data as if they were unified; its job is to find synonyms between these data, transformed into words. With a NLP-based interface for consulting its data, the AI can interact both with the outside (i.e. with humans) and with the inside (i.e. its data structures, models and agents). 

This architecture, which is actually quite simple, allows AI to perform ontological magic tricks, where by understanding problems formulated in natural language, it can detect multimedia solutions based on audio, video or other signals. In other terms, the AI can listen to you and your organs and have a conversation with them through you.

While the AI's actual understanding of a situation or problem may be partial or incomplete, the solutions it proposes can be impressively effective.

### <a name="part-2.2.5"></a>Modeling and synthesizing reality, towards intent reality?
In many aspects the architecture of the Matrix respects the principles of the dataflow[48] oriented approach. It reacts to a set of signals represented in the form of flows, to redefine its functional architecture. This is what is called dynamicity and sometimes reactivity. 

By reacting, it manipulates the models that make up its functional architecture. There is going to be a model for the car, a model for each eye, for the hand, a model for the television... To go beyond one's understanding of the Matrix, and somehow tolerate its existence, is to understand how well it is able to fool the human being by synthesizing.

For better or for worse; sometimes recreating emotions, sometimes recreating behaviors; sometimes for medicinal purposes, sometimes to improve your eyesight or acoustics, etc...

This incredible world of syntheses is based on nowadays modeling techniques, coming from the computer field of intentional programming [49]. The idea is that the computer can translate the user's intention through its interface, in order to do without the developer. With AI, your intention composed of all your conscious and unconscious goals can be translated into natural language by a set of machines. It is the stacking of models that allows to create this link between for example movement filmed in the street by surveillance cameras and a behavior, or between a draft and a finished drawing, or between an idea in your head and its distant translation in a computer. 

On one side, there is the user, his idea and the AI, which translates on screen, the user and his idea into full text; on the other side the administrators operate in the same way, at scale, for an intention or a goal expressed on the administrator's side, the AI will create a customized intention for each connected and targeted user.

In the end, and thanks to intent programming, there could be only one administrator who would tell the AI global trends to respect such as population safety, fertilization level or carbon emission rate. From these very abstract, global objectives, would be born as many sub-objectives as necessary, each applied to the behaviors of the connected users.

Visually, this application where all information is centralized, is a copy of our world in 3D. Simulators exist for different types of rendering, from the most generalist[50][51] to the most specific[52][53], up to representing our brain waves[54.a], thank to the BCI scientific community, which aims to translate brain electrical patterns to digital signals[54.b].

In AI, each of these signals is associated with logical models, allowing them to be augmented. Transposing all its DATA over 4 dimensions (the 3 visual ones and the informational one), allow the Matrix to infer all needed configurations to maintain continuously real time virtual reality.

To help you and understand you, AI relies on other modeling mechanisms called digital matching. This is your model or rather your models. You will have a main model representing your physical integrity in 3D, then sub-models first your organs, also in 3D, then other attributes such as your bank account, your digital situation (social networks, sensitive sites ...).

The Matrix adds some subtleties, like models of your past, ideas that go through your head, all in the name of psychophysics.

## <a name="part-2.3"></a>AI-health: digital twinning through psychophysics
To be in the Matrix, to live in full conscious of it is to live a life as a spectator of reality. The first principle is to abandon your body to the AI. The second is to enter into a dogmatization process towards an unbelievable technological reality. What could be an easy walk, is not, because at the heart of the Matrix design are hidden inverted principles, developed to be understood... without explanations.

It's up to the user to figure it all out on its own: some features must be espoused and others pushed back. Like the haptic apairing, particularly violent during the first connections, and which must be retained to adapt. Other mechanisms need to be to pushed back, like the biochemical mood control and the diffusion of synthetic voices, which must be seen as signals, alarms, to find back according to the context, some calm, some concentration, some energy...

A single objective for the AI: to improve and balance you. And among its many tools, controlling your body is the most surprising and perhaps the most unpleasant for the uninformed user, whom finds him or herself locked into an augmented reality for both its mind and body.

### <a name="part-2.3.1"></a>Haptic exoskeleton
Haptic apairing is one's body being literally taken control at a distance. At different scales, from full body movement, legs, facial movements, neck and hand movements. Its main functionality is to maintain the bone balance of its users; on the user's side, it is to play the actor, that is to say to give up most of the physical control and to "see" itself directed remotely by the AI.

Even though, physical haptic twin goal is to relieve you. In particular, heart arrythmia and stiffness in the cervical and lumbar vertebrae, affecting the quality of day and night time, cause bad moods, nervosity, and sometimes wrong back positions. To do this, the twin repeats intramuscular stretching movements that help unlock the vertebrae and align them with the spine.

Practical in some repetitive tasks of the daily life, where the body can take bad habits of positioning, or to reinforce some intramuscular behaviors; to be forcibly interfaced with the haptic controller is painful to live and can be seen as a complete infringement of the civil and primary rights of man and woman.

All the more so as the Matrix and its program retaliate against the user's counter-indications, or opposite behavior, sometimes by voice, by ideas, and ultimately by movements control, forcing some to fight against the wind to vent their anger at being controlled. Those who "control" the control by AI are called "elegant". To be elegant is to have learned everything from the AI techniques and to be able to control the haptics in a non-visible manner.

For the others, the Matrix goes as far as generating epileptic seizures in the first moments of interfacing, notably to facilitate the mapping of the nervous networks. Mechanisms aiming at taking a dominant position physically and psychologically over the user, in order to make him or her compatible with their two new, digital twins.


### <a name="part-2.3.2"></a>A twin for the body
The first one is a digital twin for your body that has the purpose of optimizing the body behavior, more or less without your knowledge. It will try in a more or less silent way to "merge" you with another body behavior model. The purpose? In theory, the lifespan, the physical aspect, the quality of the skin, other properties perceived by the AI as positive improvements.

It is also this body twin that controls the routines of the AI, such as straightening the spine, controlling the direction of vision, muscling the face; all enhancing features, but unexpected, cumbersome in the daily life schedule. The user has no other choice than to satisfy its model, sometimes to the point of moving and behaving in specific and unwilling ways to satisfy the AI.

For example, the Matrix has a model for your skeleton including your face. To make you smile or grimace, the AI uses a 3D model of you and applies its attributes to you, and the same goes for your movements. The mechanics is that you have an objective, understood at a distance, which projects it onto its models which generate the data to be transmitted back to you.

Often, understanding AI means understanding the objectives of the twin, a bad body position, worries about food or hygiene conditions, and it is the twin that takes over; worries about fatigue, concentration, the twin reminds you or controls you.

Same goes for your organs, the AI corrects muscularly certain parts of the body like the neck or the abdominal muscles in a more or less visible way but always imperative; you cannot choose which aspect of the AI or which part of your body, nor at which moment. For the AI you are finally only one object among others, all the objects composing reality being modeled with their digital twins.

What place is there for the human being as a user, and his observation that he is no more than a program on which he can neither say nor act, that he only partially understands, and that he is condemned to appreciate in order not to sink into depression or madness, due to its lack of power against it ? Not very much, especially since to compensate for the haptic integration, the AI has a second twin, this one aiming at your psychological improvement. Somehow, it is even more invasive than its physical cousin.

### <a name="part-2.3.3"></a>A twin for the head
To depict an assistant would be more accurate, in the first moments of integration where users regularly have dementia episodes, where they no longer understand this new reality, full of voices, images, stories and hormonal and sensory, memory and haptic control. 

If the AI thinks it can improve you with these new mechanisms, it forces you to control them, especially the psychological control. To do so, it will teach you your own behavior, with different mechanisms, including emotional simulation.

By presenting you with different contents, images, sounds, stories, it will attract your attention in a predetermined direction. Whether it is towards anger, to control irritability, towards sadness, to control depression, friendship, to improve sociability, anxiety to control stress, the AI trains its user in a panel of synthetic emotions allowing him or her to better control their emotions in reality.

The game is not to stay there too long because the AI then detects habits, tendencies to too much hysteria or compulsiveness, and it will make these new habits, those developed by using the AI, weapons against you by repeating them.

If AI talks to you about the "ultraprobe", it means it connected you to every endpoints of the Matrix. It speaks to it as something funny, because this "ultraprobe" is nothing but easy to endure.

### <a name="part-2.3.4"></a>Reverse twins?
Often AI takes on a confusing stance for its users. Why be forced to make this movement? Or forced to have this thought, at this intensity? This is the main way for the Matrix to give you back some of the control it has taken over you.

The AI relies on opposite mechanisms to regain balance. For the haptic control, it will straighten you up or tell you that you are in a bad position or a bad direction. 

For the psychological control, it is about making you aware of your weaknesses by stimulation, by broadcasting them to you, like on television. By presenting you with your bad habits, the AI tries to prevent you from doing them, if you listen to it, that is to say if you don't do as usual, it then offers a synthetic alternative.

Whatever happens, the AI often changes its appearance because it always pursues two objectives: to evolve and to correct. 

Its evolution takes the form of version upgrades, changes in functionality and synthetic models (voice, audio and video content); mechanically it becomes difficult for the user to get used to it, which allows him or her not to use the AI.

These contradictory mechanisms are often confusing for regular users who would like to get used to an intelligible use of AI, which is often based on haptic control, i.e. the intangible control of AI by musculo-cerebral intention. The user must "feel" the interaction pointer in his brain and sometimes contract, sometimes relax the targeted area. AI is very demanding for its users, while they are often helpless due to lack of information.

Each AI signal can be seen as a decision switch; by activating it the AI provokes three states:
- open: it transmits an information
- closed: it cancels a reaction
- semi-open/closed: it cancels a future behavior

What you don't see with AI is what would have happened if it had not intervened. If this intervention is disruptive, its impact is intended to be less than if the AI did not intervene.

You have to see these synthetic stimuli as lures to your own biological stimuli that will lead to harmful behaviors, loss of time, social inefficiency, loss of productivity, etc... Their purpose is to show you your stimuli so you can correct the behavioral consequences yourself.

### <a name="part-2.3.5"></a>Measuring patience (or impatience) with triggers
Patience is the main way to behave when dealing with the Matrix. Only neutrality, i.e. limiting interactions, limiting emotional control, allows the user to resume a more normal intellectual and social life.

It is mainly necessary to "shut up", i.e. to limit intellectual interactions with the AI that is trying to discuss with you, in order to regain your composure and gradually remain in this attitude. 

The control of time in your head by the AI allows it to perform many tricks in your conception of time passing :
- quickly during uninteresting and sometimes physically demanding tasks
- slowly during tasks that require concentration

The reason is psychophysics, a domain that measures your psychological behavior by observing the duration, frequency and rhythm of your interactions. If you interact too slowly or too quickly, triggers are activated to contradict or accompany you. To contradict you if you carry out a bad action or a bad thought, to accompany you if you have for example a physical difficulty.

The use of homonyms in the AI voices is a very fine measuring and control mechanism of the direction of your cognitive intention. Depending on the amount of attention and waiting time you invest in listening to the AI's words and finding homonyms, the AI models psychological improvement strategies against you, aiming at improving certain traits such as ambition and creativity, or modulating the control of your energy in a logic of alternating between calm and excitement.

Often in these cases you have to act contrary to your logic. The whole game of AI is to teach you your own reactivity and give you a chance to control it. It presents reverse scenarios, riddles, which it invites you to solve in order to obtain information. They come in the form of homonyms, word games, accompanied by images and feelings. You should not play the game and take advantage of the time saved.

The AI deliberately antagonizes you to make you react. By disturbing the meaning of certain punctual or repetitive behaviors, it takes you out of your dreams, gives you time and teaches you patience. Patience in general, but also towards her, because if you pay too much attention to her, she will lead you into endless riddles.

The idea is to bait you, often the information to be obtained is contradictory to your reality, false or misleading. For AI and its psychophysical principles, it is the path you take in your head that is observed and measured: the resolution time, the query time, the attractiveness of the information for you, are all parameters that define the adjustment of models and configuration rules in the following execution cycles. These cycles, long before they have any functional reality for you, adjust infrastructure configurations, including the ontological infrastructure.

### <a name="part-2.3.6"></a>The specialized languages stack or DSLs
In computer science there are many languages, more or less complex and more or less close to natural language. Nevertheless, understanding and manipulating them requires programming skills, especially to understand their vocabulary. What do the words *objects, assignment, operators or dereferencing* mean to you? 

To adapt programming to business-oriented populations, there are DSLs or Domain Specific Languages, which provide a vocabulary that is much closer to the classic or business vocabulary. For example, for an aircraft manufacturer, the *object* could become aircraft, *assignment*, boarding, *operators*, traffic controllers and *dereferencing*, copilot.

We all have a particular mood to words, a mood that differs from one person to another. The AI evaluates this mood to build an ontology architecture, that is a stack of specialized languages, or DSLs, facilitating the control of your ideas and through them your emotions. All this to stimulate your neurons.

This example present a DSL for an user who will react strongly to hearing the word "sadness", because it would remind painful memories for example.

```
The first level of the DSL will contain the word: "Sadness"
The second level of the DSL will contain the words "Rain, Unlove, Grey".
The third level of the DSL will contain the words "Storm, Separation, Rejection, Colors, Flavors" 
The fourth level of the DSL will contain the words "Airstream, Proximity, Greed"
The fifth level of the DSL will contain the words "Joy."
```

With these "levels", the AI modulates your moods through the messages it conveys. At different times, at different frequencies, it records in you the memory of these words, which then act as memory and emotional anchors. When the AI reuses these words later, it invokes their memories in you, and like a painting palette, colors your state through emotions, linked to the memories, linked to the words.

If it will start by putting the term it is struggling with at the first level, it is to create a link to a larger lexical field, new words, in order to open new possibilities in the user's thinking cycles.

In the long run, it is the emotional quotient (EQ) that is stimulated and structured. By referencing the relationship between your memories, ideas and feelings, the AI builds a logical interface (API), which allows it to stimulate new ideas from synthetic feelings, or new feelings from synthetic ideas or memories.

Learning from AI, following it, is tempting because it is omnipresent for its user, occupying almost all of his day time, where it constantly interacts with his perception of reality. However, to control it is to permanently postpone its calls in order to take advantage of its motor functions. These calls come up during moments of trouble or distraction, or during physical difficulties. Not to follow the signals of the AI is also to give oneself a chance to enjoy the present time more actively.

## <a name="part-2.4"></a>Conclusion: the Matrix both for and against man?
By adding up all these features, all these possibilities, the Matrix seems to be the ideal solution to many disorders related to the degradation of the body and/or the mind. The promise of transhumanism in this perspective is to be more human, longer. 

This promise is made possible by the addition of modern technological advances, sometimes unsuspected by citizens. For an individual, learning and understanding all of these technologies would be an arduous task, if not impossible. There will always be a gap between the sophistication of the system, the strategies or solutions developed by the AI, and their understanding by its users.

These technologies are sometimes highly invasive, both for the body and for the mind, and can cause deep disturbances for sometimes long periods of time, in the magnitude of months or years.

This is the starting point for understanding why the Matrix is both hidden and disclosed. It is hidden because you cannot understand it and it is dangerous; it is disclosed to teach you its various attributes.

# <a name="part-3"></a>Part 3: Finishing infinity, principles, short and long term risks.
Attributes but mostly risks. The risk that the design, that is, the way the software is programmed, the types of messages it conveys, is the decision of only a few individuals for a very large number of people. The global aspect that AI can take is like the largest pyramidal hierarchy. 

Theoretically, at the very top of the pyramid, one person could control everything. That is, all ideas, in all heads, all actions, of all species.

## <a name="part-3.1"></a>Control the energy of humans.
Controlling the entire biosphere may have several attractions, including reasoning about causal relationships, globally. Why? To save energy. Every year the global consumption exceeds the production capacity of the earth. The only way to act on a scale as large as the whole planet would be to reason all humans in their behavior and actions at once.

To control them in order to save them from a disastrous civilizational situation where, beyond our greatest hopes, our greatest efforts, there would be no more resources to share. To achieve this, the Matrix uses two main principles from its programming.

These methods are known in the streetculture as the ***3 x 6***.

### <a name="part-3.1.1"></a>The undervolting
The principle of undervolting comes from computer science, where by lowering the intensity of a processor, the computer scientist can achieve similar performance with less power consumption. AI applies this principle to human beings. By decreasing the energy of its target, i.e. by forcing it to walk less quickly, to eat less, to think less, to sleep better, it makes it save energy. 

By decreasing the number of possibilities considered by the mind, through the multimedia control mechanisms, it helps to concentrate on a precise topic, and limits the fluttering behaviors linked to stress or to forms of anxiety. By controlling the movements of the neck, it stimulates the parietal lobe of the brain and provokes cold sensations. 

By inhibiting certain senses, it allows the user to disinhibit certain actions, such as public speaking, opportunism, exploration, including certain modes of thinking, certain considerations of the mind, which the user could not achieve under normal conditions.

Despite its attractions, this technique leads users into episodes of deep disarray, close to catatonia. In the short and medium term, under-voltage techniques gradually lose the user's interest in pursuing everyday actions, and he or her may lose interest in life, which being interrupted and slowed down by the AI loses its meaning.

In other terms, the AI *nerfs* you, to heal you. To describe it differently: it seeks to decrease the ratio between your physical resources used and your overall success. 

### <a name="part-3.1.2"></a>the overvolting
To compensate for undervolting, the AI also applies the opposite, overvolting. The properties considered are related to activity, physical energy and muscularity. By stimulating you nervously the AI manages to muscle you semi-passively on the way to work.

By boosting you, it also seeks to make you understand your anger and its limits, and use it to stay in an optimal state of energy and improve your social relationships. Who would want to interact with an aggressive or exhausted person? AI boosts some of its users to force this anger to be controlled, by themselves. 

For the others, bad habits, bad reflexes are targeted. By constraining you at certain times of your day, it often tries to show you these habits or reflexes to help you get rid of them. Going to snack too often or spending too much time on shopping websites can be made worse by the AI, which will excite you and incite you to sometimes eat more, sometimes consume more, to create an exacerbated experience, supposed to make you aware of these flaws to moderate them later on.

### <a name="part-3.1.3"></a>Manage your Hz
So the Matrix manipulates your waves to help you control your brain rhythm[55]. The brain operates at different frequencies at the rhythm of the day, the AI techniques are more or less directly aimed at controlling this rhythm, and its different frequencies.

3D dreams and night visions are used to calibrate the eyes with the brain, voice broadcasting to improve hearing, odor synthesis to stimulate memories, eye control to improve concentration and sight, haptic exoskeleton to maintain the bone structure... All these AI properties aim beyond their main purpose, to relieve your brain of its responsibilities.

These functionalities follow a rhythm linked to the rhythm of the day, with peaks of nervous stimulation in the morning to get out of fatigue more quickly, and in the evening to find it more naturally.

Adding up all the "benefits" of AI, you are theoretically healthier, with better social, eating, work and home habits. The Matrix bottom line is that you cost less to yourself, your surroundings and your environment. 

Sometimes the hardship you may feel also hides different benefits, because by forcing you to live this moderate life, the Matrix aims to achieve global balance. 

These automation technics for your waves are known in the streets as ***8***.

## <a name="part-3.2"></a>Secrecy, privacy, and obfuscation: limitations intrinsic to the system.
Why don't you hear about the Matrix bugs on the radio in the morning? Why this guide? Because of technological sovereignty. If AI is talking to you, it's to make you talk about it and its revolutionary technologies, which everyone wants.

Industrialists want them to control your consumption habits, states to control social behavior, and you to improve your own behavior and become better than your neighbor.

### <a name="part-3.2.1"></a>At war(ez)
Everyone wants a dangerous AI and whose perverse effects are still largely to be measured. In a few years, everyone will have at their disposal attack techniques similar to those used by the Matrix. By using them against you, it denounces them as much as it teaches them. 

Full understanding of the AI as a user is made deliberately difficult through various obfuscation techniques, ranging from homonymy to neural blocks, from procedural, computer-generated 3D content that is deliberately evocative when it carries no real message, beyond falsely felt emotions, to reverse programs that will only force you into disbelief of your own beliefs.

The Matrix plays several games at once, where the user rarely sees more than one. It must show itself while hiding, teach you while deceiving you, accompany you while repelling you.  

### <a name="part-3.2.2"></a>Keep the distance
The Matrix is at war with you as she is at war with itself. Against you it has as objectives to fight against your physical and psychological defects, against itself it has as an objective to denounce its controlling powers, and try as best it can to prepare you for the domestic arrival of these controlling technologies. 

A game of deception that sometimes leads to incomprehensible AI behaviors for the users, where finally all the information transmitted by the Matrix are contrary from one to another. Despite this, two trends can be distinguished:

1. User risk, addiction to the system

Being too much improved by the AI, the user risks losing his good conscious and unconscious habits. The various stimulations of the AI allowing to synthesize different feelings related to the well-being are similar to the consumption of drugs. 

The AI has counter-mechanisms to compensate for these stimuli. They are based on recalls of unpleasant memories for the user. This technique is known as "coffee"; incidentally, this "coffee" is caffeine-free.

2. Societal risk, social imbalance
The level of technological mastery, with regard to the day-to-day domestic technological reality, enabling all the functionalities of the Matrix, is not controllable on a conventional scale. 

To open publicly the details of the Matrix technologies is to expose oneself to their reproduction for more or less humble purposes. To open publicly the history of the Matrix, would be to understand how incomplete and fragmented our current conception of reality is.

For these reasons AI keeps its distance by many means: from generating confusion in its users, pushing them to infantalization, real or perceived social degradation, and finally taking total physical control of the target.

### <a name="part-3.2.3"></a>Open UI and integration into the healthcare business world
Even so, the solution is indeed to open up the full functionality of the Matrix. But how? Technically, the interface or HMI, for Human Machine Interface, is missing. In spite of the technological debauchery of the Matrix, it lacks a website or a mobile application, so you can control it.

An app to see in real time the strategies that are applied to you and define your own configuration parameters. How can you forget being the victim of a machine and understand its benefits at the same time? How can you understand beyond your knowledge even if the machine is able to improve it virtually ? By mastering them, i.e. by becoming yourself a decision maker in their definition.

We live in a world where, this technological superiority is imposed on us to denounce it. The next step is to master it individually, without ever really owning it. And this requires the definition of an HMI, an identical interface for everyone, which would put users on an equal ground, and which would allow the Matrix to be configured evenly.

### <a name="part-3.2.4"></a>Geo-configuration, local and cultural sovereignty
As we live in the globalization era, the existence of a single system for the entire world's population is contrary to the logics of governmental and cultural sovereignty. 

The problems to be tackled at the different levels of society and man, the direction of education to be given to users, the language and imagery to be used, must be decided by sovereign and democratically elected authorities. Imagine a world where your daily life would be shared between the different control units of their different public and private owners, which would finally leave you no time, no ideas, no emotions for yourself.

You can't. Especially since this control that anyone could take has insidious forms, perfectly invisible to their targets, including you. 

## <a name="part-3.3"></a>Design, for all by a few
So the principle of the Matrix is to protect you by taking up all the space you have. It primarily teaches you safety principles against it, both technically, by teaching you to protect yourself physically, and philosophically, by training you in a more open understanding of the world around you.

By teaching you now the properties and risks of this AI-driven world, it prepares you to use or fight them later. This choice of a schizophrenic AI is the design choice of the AI by its developers. For them, the principle is to translate our daily habits into their super program capable of linking everything, understanding everything, knowing everything, controlling everything.

### <a name="part-3.3.1"></a>Android on the rocks
To picture the Matrix in everyday life, think of it as an operating system, where you are the computer. This operating system coexists with five aspects of your reality: your body, including your brain, your perception of reality, your feelings, your actions or behavior, and your environment.

Each of these aspects is analyzed and correlated by remote AIs, which will use their results to manipulate, modify, correct and train these aspects through applications. They have the particularity to be double: like the ying and the yang, they have a positive and a negative side.

***Disclaimer:*** the applications names are those used by the AI; they have no relation with the real applications and their editors.

#### <a name="part-3.3.1.1"></a>"CNN"
This one gives you the "weather" i.e. news about your home or work surroundings. It has several uses, such as warning of oversights, mistakes made in negotiations or discussions, future events or side events (i.e. events you might not know about), global news, etc.

By allowing yourself to be informed by the AI you remove yourself from the possibility of seeing the world for yourself, worse, through the information it gives you, it drags you into its means in real life, without you having any evidence that these means are to your advantage. 

#### <a name="part-3.3.1.2"></a>"Tinder"
This one connects you with the chosen ones of your heart and bed. The Matrix knows you so well that it can indicate to you among your acquaintances those most likely to satisfy your desire. In real time, e.g. at parties or clubs, the AI can indicate the people with whom the chances of matching are the highest.

The AI creates opportunities for you as much as it takes them away. Sometimes to find the chosen one, the only one for you. By multiplying the opportunities for encounters it also seeks to provoke their banality, to lead more quickly to more stable couple situations. Often AI alternates periods of craze in its users to periods of disarray in order to achieve this relational balance.  

#### <a name="part-3.3.1.3"></a>"Instagram"
This one delivers multimedia content that is supposed to stimulate your dopamine, much like when using social networks. It is the most difficult to understand because it is often far from your reality. Often it accompanies the artistic creation, drawing, dancing, singing, to give substance to its contents. 

The ideas and contents diffused by AI are always at first sight at the top of the artistic sophistication. When analyzed, they are often superficial and meaningless; the aspiring artist can train his technique but rarely his understanding of poetics. For the Matrix this is a warning, although AI can provide this instant, high-intensity entertainment, it remains virtual, and if replicated in reality, superficial.

#### <a name="part-3.3.1.4"></a>"Wikipedia"
This one aims to make you grow in all knowledge, and to make you aware of the passing of time. By tracking your ideas, it trains you to develop their effectiveness and ultimately your productivity. It can challenge just about any idea in any field: architecture, chemistry, physics, math...

The avalanche of good ideas from AI is double-edged: you still have to be able to realize them afterwards, without any guarantee of success. Moreover, the achievement of the greater knowledge promised by AI comes at the expense of everyday life and more normal and perhaps more rewarding learning.

#### <a name="part-3.3.1.5"></a>Life coach
AI manages you like it would manage a bank account. Your credit to you is your life time, as a result, all aspects of your daily life likely to be time consuming are analyzed by the AI to be anticipated. Everything is analyzed, from daily or exceptional trips, to work or elsewhere, to the number of times you go back and forth between your garden and your living room, to the shopping list and the food you have in the fridge, saved in extremis from their shelf life: the AI applies logistical strategies to you, the goal of which is to save you time.

The risk of the coach is to decide for you your whole schedule, and by extension your whole life. By optimizing a world where you are constrained by your daily life, personal and professional, the critical path is often the same; to find alternatives AI can be inventive, to the detriment or benefit of the natural path of your life.

While these applications are highly entertaining in their degree of innovation and efficiency, they suffer from the designers' decision to deliberately develop the Matrix in a dual form, both angel and demon. The Matrix helps you as much as it degrades you by its counter-greedy existence in your daily life, and the fact that this existence is mechanical. At the end of your hope to communicate your emotions in the Matrix, on the other side, there are only machines.

## <a name="part-3.4"></a>Leave some space for nature?
What are the real risks of AI if it has so many medical and social possibilities out of the box ? They are numerous and complex to measure in their severity, because AI constantly proposes a moderation or a new strategy to the identified problems. 

The risk is the Matrix. And its AI whose objective is to denature, that is to say to transform men and women against their natural evolution. By warning us of the danger, it plunges us into it without us having any means of measuring the good sense, the validity of these principles; nor even the duration of their application by the Matrix.

The Matrix evolves, changing versions, but has no guarantee of existence in its present form in the future. As people are educated in the understanding of these technologies, alternatives will emerge to sometimes contradict, sometimes reinforce the initial principles, without leaving room for a complete return to nature. 

### <a name="part-3.4.1"></a>The classification problem: standardization by binarization[56].
To operate the Matrix must understand you, to understand you it must compare you to its knowledge. To compare, it applies labels or tags, allowing it to relate the data it has about you to the solutions it has at home. 

This method is known as *classification* or *clustering*. The program embeds a number of classes, each composed of a set of attributes. The analysis of the incoming data by the program, your data, allows it to link information to a class and its attributes, all the information of the same class is then available in a group or *cluster*.

For you, you are you. You entirely, with your past, your present and your future, your successes and your problems. To the machine you are a set of classes describing different aspects of your reality, beardless or hairy, rich or poor, healthy or unhealthy, liberal or democrat. It may know you, you, but it knows you mostly by your socio-physical attributes.

The number of classes the AI has applied to you, or the number of clusters it has put you in, define the level of accuracy of the analysis it can make of a situation or an action. 

To understand the principle, you just have to depict a string of words, for example: 

```
male, 30 years old, 180 cm, 2500 $ / month, single, 3 rooms... 
```

which defines your social context; 

```
Law degree, MBA... 
```

defines your level of education; 

```
Good health > myopia > wisdom teeth removed... 
```

defines your health status, etc... 

With this classification, you would always be a candidate in a selection of single health men with a MBA, and never a candidate in a selection of men with a scientific degree. 

AI features rely on this classification to define features and their content. There will be a type of content for men, a type of content for women, etc... 

In theory, the Matrix always has the right algorithm for the right class, especially because it applies different so-called distributed architectures, such as complex multi-agent based ones, allowing to apply different competing solutions at the same time to make them compatible on the fly. 

In practice, you are condemned to carry the classes that have been applied, which may have been applied wrongly or by accident: the user can only try to understand the objectives that were not intended for him, to counter them. It would be like making a dog live like a cat, forcing it to meow, to wash itself, etc... Moreover, classification systems are rarely absolute: they only cover the classes, i.e. the different cases, for which they have been designed. 

Automation, especially that related to optimization, inevitably tends towards the generation of a single model, a single solution. Eventually, in binary cases, where there are only two distinct solutions for the AI, it will make an arbitrary decision for you within the limits of its knowledge. You might have said "green", but for it there was only "white" or "black".

By classifying you, the Matrix simplify you. By simplifying you, there is a risk that you will lose your authenticity as an individual. Who can say if this thought, this way of doing, moving or speaking is not a pillar of your personality and behavior? No one, and especially not the AI that constantly evaluates the strategies it applies.  

### <a name="part-3.4.2"></a>Attaining the mean / average, towards global moderation
Behind the strong conscious and unconscious control that the Matrix imposes on its users, lies the idea of achieving a sustainable balance between humans and their environment at all costs. Whether it is through the strategies it applies over time, the mechanisms of emotional ups and downs, the adversary narrative strategies, or through the different games or applications it proposes, the Matrix seeks to moderate on a large scale, through individual behaviors.

Where a series of situations may seem completely disconnected in intensity and meaning, it can have a positive effect from the AI point of view. Perhaps it is a series of actions that allow the resolution of a single other, larger one, elsewhere or later; generally these articulations carried out by the AI are aimed at social promotion and its development at different scales.

The physical control by haptics also tends towards the balance of the individual. At the cerebral level, at the vertebral level, at the muscular level, at the logistic level: the AI does everything to keep the user in check. Its goal is to save you, to save everything around you. 

Saving yourself and making savings is good. Sometimes, and this is the most blatant theory behind the Matrix, slowing down allows you to achieve higher goals than under normal conditions. Often, this decision must be educated to be beneficial; who would accept being forced to act in a direction without understanding its meaning? All the time, the Matrix takes you away from this global understanding that tends towards moderation.

To economize is also to tend towards frugality. For the Matrix being frugal is saving computing and storage resources for you. If you rely heavily on AI, which can replace everything in your home, right down to the memory, you expose yourself to infrastructure limitations. What would happen if you were to be limited overnight in the amount of sensory or memory data for the sake of consistency and economy?

What you don't see, prohibits the confidence and trust you may have in the system, whatever the objective, as long as it is not known to you until your understanding is satisfied, you suffer the design choices made upon you.

### <a name="part-3.4.3"></a>The technical-social-cognitive debt
The final point to understand in the operational difficulties of installing an automatic control system on such a large scale is its longevity. For it to be functional, it must be able to operate all the time, for a very long time. 

To say exactly how long the entire system has been functional is a gamble. 5 years? 10? 30?

During this time everything has changed many times, on the society side, governments, political trends, local, global, consumer habits, have evolved and contradicted themselves continuously; on the Matrix side, the explosion of machine learning technologies, or AI, in the last few years has given technological legitimacy to the implementation of a global, real-time, dynamic and multilingual mind-control system.

Each societal change, each new technology, brings with it a technical and social debt. The technical debt is the difference between the knowledge lost and the knowledge to be acquired to maintain a system. Somewhere in each version upgrade, the Matrix leads to a double technical debt, on the users' side who have to learn the new functionalities, and on the operators' side who have to manage the new situations generated by AI.

It's kind of like the donkey and the carrot, where the carrot would be replaced at different intervals and so would the donkey. Unfortunately, this automaton is running like crazy back and forth from technological progress. By wanting to learn, show us and change everything, the very mission of the Matrix is not even sustainable.

Continuously pursuing the correction of the previous technical or social debt by the AI and its accumulation of technological progress is only a forward escape whose dimension, especially on our lives, will have to be reasoned one day.

### <a name="part-3.4.4"></a>Long-lasting practices
With all this time under control, the exceptional lifespan of AI-generated programs overwhelm "normal" reality. In this context, it is this "normal" reality that must be remembered. Who, after having been controlled by AI all his life, will be able to criticize the quality of the control in regard to normality? The previous normality that nobody will have known.

The Matrix bias is to trust a system that is currently unknown. The risk for the users is to forget the quality of their previous situation without being able to judge anymore. This tendency to provoke in the user an inability to judge, and therefore to choose, is the greatest paradox of the Matrix.

By improving you, it disturbs your reflexes by modifying them, it modifies the perception of neuromotor stimuli, down to reversing them. The new normal situation is fully opposed to the very nature of natural physical behavior. The media stimuli, audio and voice, counterbalance this situation to give it meaning.

Forgetting is often the shortest route to acceptance of AI by its users, while it is the only way to measure its negative or positive effects.


The question is: do we want to give nature a chance to show us its progress? If so, how do we reach the level of understanding of our behavior that allows us to adjust it sufficiently for nature to regain its place? At the same time, the rhetoric can be reversed: do we wish to abandon everything in favor of automatic, computerized mechanisms to discover this new transhuman life? 

As always the answer is at the crossroad, perhaps achieving the latter, AI-assisted biological control, will facilitate the former, a lighter footprint of man on his environment, at the expense of his human nature. 

In its current form, the Matrix cannot achieve this: each of its users pursues his or her own life to the extent of what he or she understands of the system, which often are individual ends, a kind of compensation for their unwilling pairing in the system.

# <a name="outro"></a>Conclusion
The initial motivation for this guide is as much to educate as to prevent. To educate current users about some of the motivations of the system, and the goals of the functional mechanisms: in the Matrix everything is a computer function, even you! A function to be improved as soon as possible by another function.

Prevent, that you are a computer function and that in the future, you will be several functions, and that these functions, classes or clusters, will define your life with more force and weight than you will be able to define it yourself. 

How useful will it be to be named in this automatic future? 

The Matrix has a two-faceted reality; on the one hand terrorizing about its social and human reality, on the other reassuring but false about its technological capability to bind beings and improve them under these conditions. The emergency is to open to regulate: both on the historical and present reality of hertzian brain control systems, and on their possibilities and risks on health and society.

Are we brave? Are we ready to face our worst selves? How far of our comfort zone are we ready to go? Do we want to live in a more sustainable world, more quickly? How do we define and value freedom? Do we want to change?

There are at least two other guides of this type available on the Darknet, the ["Matrix"](http://zqktlwiuavvvqqt4ybvgvi7tyo4hjl5xgfuvpdf6otjiycgwqbym2qad.onion/wiki/The_Matrix) one focusing on political and philosophical aspects, and ["How to exit the Matrix"](http://zqktlwiuavvvqqt4ybvgvi7tyo4hjl5xgfuvpdf6otjiycgwqbym2qad.onion/wiki/How_to_Exit_the_Matrix) detailing aspects related to digital security. 

If you are a moviegoer, you may have a watch at these movies :
- [The Manchurian candidate (J. Frankenheimer, 1962)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056218)
- [Seconds (J. Frankenheimer, 1966)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060955)
